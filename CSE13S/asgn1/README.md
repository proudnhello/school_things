To run this script, simply run ./plot.sh from the command line.  
./plot.sh accepts no arguments.  
This should create four pdfs in the directory plot.sh is located in, each one containing a different graph based on the collatz sequence for numbers 2 through 10000.  
One graph shows the length of collatz sequences.  
Another plots the maximum values of collatz sequences, with outliers removed.  
A third shows the frequency of collatz sequence lengths.  
And the final compares the collatz sequence lengths with the maximum value for those sequence lengths, with outliers removed.
