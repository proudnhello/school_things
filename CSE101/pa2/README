List.h provides the List ADT  
List.c is the implementation of the List ADT  
Graph.h is the Graph ADT  
Graph.c is the implementation of the Graph ADT  
GraphTest.c was used to test the implementation of the Graph ADT.  
It can be compiled with make test, then run with ./test  
FindPath.c will recreate an undirected Graph from a file, then calculate a path between nodes.  
It can be compiled with make or make FindPath, and run with ./FindPath <input> <output>.  
If a line contains two ints, and then a character, the program will ignore the character and anything else on the line past it.  
IE, given the line "2 3 e", the program will simply parse 2 and 3 and ignore everything else in the line. 
However, given 3 ints, the program will throw an error, and characters located anywhere else will also cause errors.
